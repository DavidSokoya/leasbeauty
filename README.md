## How It's Made

**Tech used:**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- TailwindCSS

### Development Process

Leas Beauty was built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to ensure a responsive, fast, and scalable application. The backend handles admin authentication, appointment scheduling, and database management, while the frontend provides a clean, intuitive interface for seamless user interaction.

Key features implemented:

- Admin authentication and secure login
- Appointment scheduling and management
- Mobile-responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- RESTful API integration for smooth frontend-backend communication

## How It Works

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavidSokoya/leasbeauty.git
cd leasbeauty
```

### 2. Set up the backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

- Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add the following:

  ```plaintext
  MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
  JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
  PORT=5000
  ```

- Start the backend server:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

### 3. Set up the frontend

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The app should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`. The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`.
Create a user with email and password and change the role to "ADMIN" from the database

### 4. Create an account




## Optimizations 
I plan to improve Leas Beauty by refactoring API calls for faster load times and responsiveness. Implementing MongoDB indexing will speed up database queries. Iâ€™ll enhance the UI with image lazy loading and compression for quicker rendering. Lastly, CI/CD pipelines will streamline deployment and updates for smoother releases.

## Lessons Learned

While building Leas Beauty, I gained deeper insights into:

- Managing state efficiently in React applications.
- Implementing secure user authentication using JWT and bcrypt.
- Structuring RESTful APIs for scalability.
- Enhancing user experience with responsive UI design.
- The importance of writing clean, maintainable code, and using best practices for performance optimization.

This project reinforced my passion for building user-centric applications and sharpened my full-stack development skills.
